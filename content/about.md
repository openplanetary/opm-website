  We are a group of professionals in the field of planetary science and exploration who are passionate about maps
and democratising planetary mapping on the web.

### How it started

The OpenPlanetaryMap project started off in 2015 as an [ESAC](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESAC/)'s trainee project in
collaboration with [CARTO](https://carto.com/) to build an interactive map of the ExoMars 2020 rover landing sites.
The **"Where On Mars?"** interactive map was designed as a storymap
guiding people through the main scientific and engineering constraints for the selection of the ExoMars 2020 rover
landing site. It lets you explore Mars and each candidate landing site.

The success of the "Where On Mars?" interactive map encouraged us to build something more ambitious:
an **Open Planetary Mapping** platform that would enable people to easily share location-based knowledge and create maps
of planets and moons in our solar system.
Thanks to the [Europlanet's Public Engagement Funding Scheme in 2017](https://www.europlanet.org/outreach/funding-scheme/funding-scheme-case-studies/#2017),
we managed to make some progress towards this goal. Our main focus was on designing high-quality basemaps for Mars and
the Moon that are engaging for the broader public, yet scientifically rigorous. This work lead to the publication of the
_"Towards a new face for Planetary Maps"_ paper and the [OPM Mars basemap v0.2](../basemaps/mars/opm-mars-basemap-v0-2)
XYZ map tiles.

Despite the success of our Mars basemap, we acknowledge that we did not deliver on the promise of an Open Planetary
Mapping platform. A title too ambitious maybe?

### What's next?

We are seeking an institutional partner to help us secure the long-term availability of our basemaps. We also intend to
improve our current basemaps for Mars and the Moon, and expand to other planetary bodies such Mercury, Venus, and
the Jovian moons. In particular, we would like to provide vector tiles and map styles based on an _"open planetary
layers schema"_ similarly to the [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/schema/) schema for OpenStreetMap layers.
